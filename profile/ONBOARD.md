# Onboarding Process

1. Go to our website and fill out the contact form with your organization's information 

2. Fork our [public registry](https://github.com/thebettermint/registry) and add your organization to the registry.json in the src/ folder. For more information, review the registry readme instructions [here](https://github.com/thebettermint/registry)

3. Submit a pull request and wait... If we need any further information during our onboard review process, we contact you using the email provided in the contact form on our website

4. Our admin will review the pull request and merge if everything looks correct. Be on the lookout for comments, and requests for modification attached to the pull request.

5. Once merged, our mint bot will be updated to automatically include your organization's account and initiatives.
 
6. Our team will provide your organization with a unique API USER_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY for access to NFT analytics, tokenIds, and offerIds. This information will come in handy for monitoring the status of the bot and allowing for a seamless way to claim newly minted NFTs.
