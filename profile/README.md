# Introduction

With TheBetterMint, we provide scalable, nonfungible token (NFT) infrastructure solution to enable applications with NFT services & capabilities. Our platform’s services are especially beneficial for organizations seeking to unlock more value & rich features for their customers by integrating deeper into blockchain technology. TheBetterMint platform seeks to spark & enable innovation around NFTs by providing a quick and easy way to implement automated minting on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

With the proposed amendment vote for the XLS-20d protocol still yet to be implemented, we currently have a functional platform developed, tested, and deployed around the XLS20 devnet. Businesses seeking to stay one step ahead of innovation are welcome to start co-developing their integration with TheBetterMint to unlock NFT functionality for their applications and services.

# Capabilities

We offer a configurable time-based and demand-based minting service approach on the XRP Ledger. These minting services can be implemented over specific periods of time, or repeated, for a uniform experience across a client’s user base.

### Time-Based Minting 
*Minting can take place at certain time intervals to help serve customers. For instance, a client may need to mint, or pay, a customer every month for a particular service or event. TheBetterMint platform offers clients a reliable way to make this happen.*

### Event-Based Minting  
*Typically, services are rendered upon a received payment. A client may want to only mint an NFT once a payment has been sent, validated, and received to their wallet on the ledger. For this use case, TheBetterMint would subscribe to a particular on-chain event and mint a unique NFT according to the clients' needs.*

### Demand-Based Minting 
*TheBetterMint offers an on-demand minting service through a dedicated API. Clients can mint tokens using TheBettermint minting platform by making an API call and waiting a few seconds for the tokenID and a claim offer. This claim offer can only be accepted by the client's wallet.*

# Use-Case Implementations with our Partners

### Give XRP xApp

*By partnering with the Give XRP team, we brought NFT functionality to their xApp, enabling their users to receive a claimable NFT tax credit, or certificate of donation, as a result of making a charitable donation using the XRP Ledger. This closed-end solution is completely automated and directly suited to the needs of the Give XRP application. View the demo here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1XyMNVr9Hs)*

Integrating TheBetterMint automated NFT minting platform into our charitable crypto donations app gave us an important piece of the puzzle.
